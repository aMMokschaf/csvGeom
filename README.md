Convert Lists of Coordinates to GeoJSON-geometry-Format for iDAI.field / Field Desktop

Python script that converts csv-Lists (currently only of the format stated below) to (currently only) Polygons used in [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON)-files. The chosen file will be saved as "*filename*_polygon.txt" in the same place as the original file. The contents of the resulting txt-file can be copied into the "Geometry"-Field of a Resource in [iDAI.field 2 / Field Desktop client](https://github.com/dainst/idai-field) with the type of geometry being "Polygon". This way, exports from total stations can be relatively easy transferred to the database. 

## Use this without installing Python

Many colleagues who could maybe use a script like this one do not have python readily installed on their computers. In this case, you can use this script without installing python itself. The *.exe attached to [each release](https://github.com/lsteinmann/csvGeom/releases) works perfectly fine (without installing anything).

## Format of the csv-File
Currently, the format of the csv-File **has** to be exactly: "PtID,East,North,Height" in the first row, and corresponding coordinates in the rows below (see examples). The decimal separator is "**.**". Currently, the height value has to exists or there will be redundand commata and the geometry will not work. Set to 0 if neccessary. For example, the csv-File may look like this: 

|PtID|East|North|Height|
|----|---:|---:|---:|
|TE33_01|10.000765844571617|53.564714308986836|0|
|TE33_02|10.003275866953757|53.566722326892553|0|
|TE33_03|10.003777871430186|53.571575036831355|0|
| etc. | etc. | ... | ... |
|TE33_16|9.998925161491382|53.562204286604697|0|
|TE33_17|10.000765844571617|53.564714308986836|0|

And the resulting txt-file will contain this: 

```
[
    [
        [
            10.000765844571617,
            53.564714308986836,
            0
        ],
        [
            10.003275866953757,
            53.566722326892553,
            0
        ],
        ... etc.
    ]
]
```

And the resulting polygon is this:

```geojson
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": 1,
